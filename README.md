A swagger-ui fork with an easy to read, responsive three pane view. Used on https://developer.cimpress.io.

Swagger UI uses client-side Javascript (jQuery + Backbone) to download a swagger.json resource and make "Try It" requests to the described endpoints. You can learn more about the swagger-ui project at the upstream source: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui
